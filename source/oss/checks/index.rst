What are Giskard Checks?
========================

Giskard Checks is a lightweight Python library for testing and evaluating non-deterministic applications such as LLM-based systems.


Overview
--------

**Giskard Checks** provides a flexible and powerful framework for testing AI applications including RAG systems, agents, summarization models, and more. Whether you're building chatbots, question-answering systems, or complex multi-step workflows, Giskard Checks helps you ensure quality and reliability.

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Built-in Check Library**: Ready-to-use checks including LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, string matching, equality assertions, and more
* **Flexible Testing Framework**: Support for both single-turn and multi-turn scenarios with stateful trace management
* **Type-Safe & Modern**: Built on Pydantic for full type safety and validation
* **Async-First**: Native async/await support for efficient concurrent testing
* **Highly Customizable**: Easy extension points for custom checks and interaction patterns
* **Serializable Results**: Immutable, JSON-serializable results for easy storage and analysis
